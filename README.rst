**ezvis3d** stands for easy vis.js/Graph3d. `vis.js Graph3d`_ is a
popular, flexible, versatile, user friendly 3d visualisation javascript
library.

**ezvis3d** is a wrapper that lets you transparently access the full
configuration options of the library as described in their APIs,
directly from the `Jupyter notebook`_.

You just need to store the data in a `pandas`_ dataframe.
See the examples in these notebooks:
+ the `demo notebook`_
+ a `Black and Scholes formula viewer`_.

    pip install ezvis3d
